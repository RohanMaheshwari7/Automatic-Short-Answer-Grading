EV.12b.102.1,incorrect,"0 to 25 milliliters, 0 to 25 milliliters because the plants all grew from 0 to 25 milliliters of water."
EV.12b.103.1,correct,"10 to 20 milliliters of water. Pot 2, 3, and 4 had been watered between 10 and 20 milliliters of water and they were the only ones that grew."
EV.12b.105.1,correct,"10 to 20 milliliters water, I looked at which plant roots grew."
EV.12b.109.1,correct,"10 to 20 milliliters of water, none grew in one or 5 so those do not count for range of tolerance."
EV.12b.113.1,correct,"10 to 20 milliliters, Well in pot one nothing grew same in pot 5 so the one that grew are a range of tolerance form 10 milliliters to 20 milliliters."
EV.12b.114.1,correct,"10 milliliters to 20 milliliters, on chart 2 pot 2, 3, and 4 grew and one and 5 did not, on chart one pot 2 was given 10 milliliters, pot 3 15 milliliters, and pot 4 20 milliliters."
EV.12b.115.1,correct,"10 to 20 milliliters, How I found the range of tolerance was I looked at which roots grew and found 10 to 20 only grew."
EV.12b.120.1,incorrect,"15 milliliters of water, looking at the graphs."
EV.12b.127.1,incorrect,"5, because some grew but not many so that is why I choose it."
EV.12b.128.1,incorrect,"5 to 25 milliliters, Because the chart says they only give them 5 milliliters to 25 milliliters."
EV.12b.132.1,correct,"10 to 20 milliliters, Because 10 to 20 milliliters of water is when they started to grow and when the root stopped."
EV.12b.138.1,incorrect,"25, I remembered the observations of Alice and put them in the questions to help me answer the questions."
EV.12b.139.1,incorrect,"20 milliliters, Because the most water is 25 milliliters and in column 5 nothing grew. So I went to the next column which is 20 milliliters, and something grew."
EV.12b.140.1,incorrect,"20 milliliters, The last number 4 and everyday she used 20 milliliters."
EV.12b.142.1,incorrect,"5, Because they can still live in that amount of water."
EV.12b.143.1,incorrect,"25 milliliters, I looked at the graph."
EV.12b.144.1,incorrect,"3, Because, it is the most and the highest one the for it."
EV.12b.148.1,correct,"10 to 20 milliliters, I looked at the root length and only 3 had lengths. The lowest was low and the highest was 20."
EV.12b.154.1,incorrect,"60 milliliters, How I decided I add up all the numbers of the graph."
EV.12b.162.1,incorrect,"25 milliliters, The highest water bar."
EV.12b.164.1,incorrect,"15 milliliters, Because pot 3 grew the best with 15 milliliters."
EV.12b.171.1,correct,"10 to 20 milliliters In the second graph, pot 2, 3, and 4 actually grew. In the first graph, pot 2, 3, and 4 had water between 10 to 20 milliliters."
EV.12b.173.1,incorrect,It should be 10 because it grew 9 inches and it had.
EV.12b.188.1,incorrect,"10 milliliters, Because it starts growing at 10 milliliters."
EV.12b.190.1,correct,"10 to 20, I decided those numbers because those are the ones that actually had roots and were growing."
EV.12b.194.1,incorrect,"10 to 15, I decided because they almost look the same."
EV.12b.196.1,incorrect,"3, because if there a good amount of water it will work."
EV.12b.207.1,incorrect,"20, I subtracted the highest amount of water by the least and it seemed to be that much."
EV.12b.209.1,incorrect,"25 water milliliters, the root of the graph 4 inches, 5 inches, 8 inches."
EV.12b.219.1,incorrect,"The same, because they all sat next to the same window."
EV.12b.381.1,correct,"10 to 20 milliliters, Because I saw that 2 to 4 on the roots graph where the only one that grow. So 2 to 4 on the water graph have good amounts."
EV.12b.382.1,correct,"10 milliliters to 20 milliliters, Because if you put that amount plants will grow but if you put the other amounts you get no plants."
EV.12b.386.1,incorrect,"3 centimeters, because it is the tallest root length and the plants will be taller."
EV.12b.389.1,incorrect,"2 to 4 milliliters, Because on the chart 2 to 4 was the only one that barely grew."
EV.12b.390.1,correct,"10 to 20 milliliters of water, pot 2 got 10 milliliters and grew roots and 15 milliliters for pot 3 and it grew roots and pot 4 had 20 milliliters and grew roots. The first pot did not have enough milliliters and the last one had too much milliliters."
EV.12b.393.1,incorrect,"4, 4 because there is less seeds but it would grow more."
EV.12b.397.1,correct,"10 milliliters to 20 milliliters, because then plants only grew in 10, 15, and 20 milliliters and they were able to tolerate it."
EV.12b.398.1,correct,"10 to 20 milliliters, because the second graph tells me the roots only grow in pots 2, 3, and 4. The water from pot 2, 3, and 4 is from 10 to 20 milliliters so I think it is the best range of tolerance."
EV.12b.399.1,incorrect,"25 milliliters, Because 25 milliliters of water is too much water for radish seeds. The seeds could get soaked and die because of too much water."
EV.12b.401.1,incorrect,"6 centimeters to 22 centimeters, Because when she put 5 milliliters of water no plants grew. And when she put in 25 milliliters of water no plants grew. So it is no lower 5 milliliters and no higher than 25 milliliters."
EV.12b.403.1,correct,"10 milliliters to 20 milliliters, Look at the amounts that made the plants grow."
EV.12b.404.1,correct,"10 milliliters to 20 milliliters, because on the graph it show that the root grew on 2, 3, and 4, So I look at how much water was given and wrote 10 milliliters to 20 milliliters."
EV.12b.406.1,incorrect,"15 milliliters, pot 3 had the longest roots then the others so I compared the 2 graphs and got 15 milliliters."
EV.12b.416.1,incorrect,"10 to 15 milliliters, That is the right amount because in the graph the second largest was watered with 10 milliliters of water and is not too much or too little."
EV.12b.419.1,incorrect,"15 to 20 milliliters, I if you subtract 5 milliliters from 25 milliliters you get 20 milliliters and I get 15 milliliters as the optimum amount of water so I put 15 milliliters to 20 milliliters."
EV.12b.420.1,incorrect,"10 to 15, Well, if you go past 15 that will be too much and if you go below 10 that will be too little so it is just right. So it will be around 12, 13, 14, or 15."
EV.12b.421.1,correct,"10 to 20, I decided that because those are the numbers that had long roots."
EV.12b.428.1,correct,"10 milliliters to 20 milliliters, those were the plants with roots."
EV.12b.429.1,incorrect,"20 milliliters, Range mean biggest number and lowest number subtracted by."
EV.12b.430.1,correct,"10 to 20 milliliters, Because those are the distances of which the plants grow in."
EV.12b.431.1,incorrect,"20 milliliters, Because after 20 milliliters the seeds roots were 0 centimeters."
EV.12b.432.1,incorrect,"20 milliliters, To find the range you have got to take the lowest amount of water and subtract that from the highest amount of water. If the highest amount is 25 milliliters and the lowest is 5 milliliters you have got to do 25 minus 5 equals 20 milliliters. So 20 milliliters is the range."
EV.12b.434.1,incorrect,10 to 20 milliliters to 10 to 20 milliliters is the amount of water needed to help the radish seeds roots to grow.
EV.12b.436.1,incorrect,"5, Because 5 milliliters makes the plant grow much bigger and faster."
EV.12b.437.1,incorrect,"15, Because when I matched the charts, I found out that pot 2 had the longest roots for only 15 milliliters. Even though pot 5 had the most water some of it roots did not grow."
EV.12b.438.1,correct,"10 milliliters to 20 milliliters, because the plants that were inside that range all grew."
EV.12b.439.1,incorrect,"5 to 25, The same way I decided the optimum amount."
EV.12b.443.1,incorrect,"20 milliliters, I decided 20 milliliters because I took 75 milliliters subtract 5 milliliters in the first graph."
EV.12b.446.1,incorrect,"15 milliliters, because the length of the root of pot 3 was he largest."
EV.12b.449.1,incorrect,"15 milliliters, It grows the longest roots."
EV.12b.454.1,correct,"10 to 20 milliliters, The graph that has the root length has only numbers 2, 3, and 4 that have roots, comparing it to the first graph, I got 10 to 20 milliliters of water."
EV.12b.461.1,incorrect,"15 to 20 milliliters, Once again I used the charts to get this answer."
EV.12b.462.1,incorrect,"West one to 5, They have first and last one, they have most difference and I think the wet environment is the best, also the 15 milliliters water is the best."
EV.12b.465.1,incorrect,"15 milliliters, I decide the third pot which had 15 milliliters of water because the root was 8 centimeters. The one which is the highest."
EV.12b.468.1,correct,"10 milliliters to 20 milliliters, because it grew in pots 2, 3, and 4 which had from 10 milliliters to 20 milliliters and they were the only pots that had growth."
EV.12b.471.1,correct,"10 to 20 milliliters, I compared the growth to the water from the charts given."
EV.12b.472.1,correct,"10 to 20 milliliters, The range of tolerance is the range that the plant can grow and the plants grew with this amount of water."
EV.12b.473.1,incorrect,"3 pots, Because it is the best one out of them all."
EV.12b.486.1,incorrect,"3, because on the scale it was the third smallest and then grew the tallest."
EV.12b.487.1,incorrect,"3, The 15 milliliters of water for the third pot is the highest."
EV.12b.489.1,incorrect,"8, The range of tolerance was 9 because the radish plant grew big, 8 centimeters."
EV.12b.494.1,incorrect,"Pot 3, because do not need that much of water or need that little of water."
EV.12b.496.1,incorrect,I did not know so I just put 5.
EV.12b.497.1,incorrect,"15 milliliters, I think it is 15 milliliters because the bar graph showed it was the highest."
EV.12b.498.1,incorrect,"20, I looked at the graph."
EV.12b.506.1,incorrect,"3, 3 because it took 3 days for it to grow 8 centimeters and 8 centimeters is the limit on the graph."
EV.12b.510.1,incorrect,"50 milliliters, because that is how much we put in."
EV.12b.523.1,correct,"10 milliliters to 20 milliliters, from looking at the chart I saw that pot 2 and 4 was around 3."
EV.12b.524.1,incorrect,"0 to 15, I looked at the chart and It said that pot 3 got 15 milliliters and on the bottom chart pot 3 grew the best."
EV.12b.526.1,incorrect,"45 centimeters, I add up the root length and the water together and got 45 centimeters."
EV.12b.529.1,incorrect,"10 milliliters, I saw the plant that grew the least and checked the water amount."
EV.12b.531.1,incorrect,5 to 25 milliliters of water.
EV.12b.532.1,incorrect,"No, because in one pot did not grow and the fifth did not grow too that why I said no."
EV.12b.536.1,incorrect,"5, I think the range is 5 because it is right in the middle of 4 and 6."
EV.12b.538.1,incorrect,"15 to 20 milliliters, look at the graph."
EV.12b.542.1,incorrect,"10 milliliters to 20 milliliters. Because pot 2, 3, and 4 have the longest roots and if you look at how much water they give it, it would be 10 milliliters to 20 milliliters."
EV.12b.545.1,incorrect,"33 milliliters, Because all together it is 33, 25 plus 8 equals 33."
EV.12b.547.1,correct,"10 milliliters to 20 milliliters of water. On the root graph pot 2, 3 and 4 were the only ones that had root so I looked at the other graph and looked at the same pot number and then looked at the water amount."
EV.12b.548.1,incorrect,"In the water, because the radish must be grown in 25 milliliters."
EV.12b.591.1,incorrect,"25 milliliters, It is the biggest amount of water the plants drink in the top graph."
EV.12b.594.1,correct,"10 milliliters to 20 milliliters, I looked at which roots actually grew and then looked at how much water they got."
EV.12b.600.1,incorrect,"Adding in 5, Because he is adding 5 because one pot is 5 pot 2 is 10 and on."
EV.12b.601.1,incorrect,"5 milliliters, By looking at the graph it is going by 5 milliliters."
EV.12b.605.1,correct,"10 to 20 milliliters. Since pot 2, 3, and 4 grew roots, I assumed the amount of water in pot 2, 3 and 4 would be best."

EV.12b.626.1,incorrect,"20 milliliters, The least number that was used and subtract it with the highest number that was used."
EV.12b.628.1,incorrect,"One to 07 milliliters, because you could kill your plant."
EV.12b.632.1,incorrect,"0 to 25 milliliters, because it was 0 all the way up to the number on the chart which was 25."
EV.12b.644.1,correct,"10 to 20 milliliters, I looked at the roots that has grown than looked at the plants to go with it."
EV.12b.650.1,incorrect,"15 milliliters, because 3 was 15 milliliters."
