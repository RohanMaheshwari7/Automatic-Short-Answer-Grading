LF.27a.391.1,correct,"40, Because between each is 20 and if you times 20 twice you will get 40."
LF.27a.393.1,correct,"40, C is next to B so you add 20 meters to the elevation contour line band A."
LF.27a.400.1,correct,"40 meters, The contour interval is 20 meters."
LF.27a.404.1,incorrect,"225, You keep adding 75."
LF.27a.405.1,incorrect,Because it is the its spread apart.
LF.27a.408.1,incorrect,"60 meters, Because it said the change in elevation from line A to B is 20 meters so that lets me know to count by 20 meters."
LF.27a.421.1,correct,"40, Because it is 20 thought A to B and B to C."
LF.27a.427.1,incorrect,"283 meters, Because A is higher."
LF.27a.436.1,incorrect,"45, Because you can tell by the lines."
LF.27a.437.1,incorrect,25 meters.
LF.27a.444.1,incorrect,"30 meters, I measured with my fingers that C was half of B, and since B is 20 and half of that is 10 I added both of them together and got 30 meters."
LF.27a.446.1,incorrect,"360, big the line of the A, B, C, D."
LF.27a.452.1,incorrect,"C, Because it said the change in elevation for A and B was 20 meters and since it 20 they might be counting by 20's so that is my answer."
LF.27a.462.1,correct,"40, because if it is like then to get to C just add another 20 meters."
LF.27a.468.1,incorrect,"30, well because if A and B equals 20 meters and B true C looked like 10 more meters and I think is 30 meters."
LF.27a.471.1,incorrect,"30, I know because A and B is 20 meters and B to C is about 10 meters and it is almost close together."
LF.27a.481.1,incorrect,"30, because if you could change A on B so you A and C."
LF.27a.487.1,correct,"40 meters, now I know is if A to B is 20 meters than A to C is 40 because you add another."
LF.27a.492.1,incorrect,"A, they are closer to each other."
LF.27a.497.1,correct,"40 meters, Because the contour numbers or lines are counting by 20 meters."
LF.27a.499.1,incorrect,"60 meters, you are just doubling it."
LF.27a.501.1,incorrect,"60 meters, I labeled them. I also knew C is the third letter in the alphabet so I counted by 20 3 times."
LF.27a.507.1,incorrect,"30 meters, Because if you look at A and then C. C get a lower amount by subtracting."
LF.27a.510.1,correct,"40 meters, I know this because A to B is 20 meters and the next contour line is another 20 meters away it must be 40 meters."
LF.27a.512.1,incorrect,"Feet, because it has a great space between."
LF.27a.517.1,correct,"40 meters, I know this because the contour interval is 20 meters."
LF.27a.664.1,incorrect,"40 meters, each line goes up 20 meters."
LF.27a.668.1,correct,"40 meters, It is counting by 20's, 0, 20, 40, 60."
LF.27a.676.1,incorrect,"40 meters, It is on an accurate scale."
LF.27a.850.1,incorrect,"30, I halved what A and B was."
LF.27a.855.1,correct,"40 meters, I know this because contour intervals do not change and 20 plus 20 equals 40."
LF.27a.856.1,incorrect,"50 meters, It is double the length of B plus 10 meters."
LF.27a.873.1,incorrect,"23 meters, I know because all you do is draw a line to line C."
LF.27a.906.1,correct,"40 meters, I know because the distance between contour lines do not change."
LF.27a.922.1,correct,"40, I know because the distance between every line is 20, since 20 plus 20 equals 40."
LF.27a.937.1,correct,"40 meters, I know because the contour line is 20. So since A and B is 20 add 20 more."
